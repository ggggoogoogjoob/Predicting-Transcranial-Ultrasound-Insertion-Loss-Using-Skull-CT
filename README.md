# Predicting-Transcranial-Ultrasound-Insertion-Loss-Using-Skull-CT

Transcranial ultrasound (tUS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with applications in brain disorders. However, attenuation induced by skull significantly affects focal energy transmission. The loss of ultrasound intensity can be quantified by Insertion loss (IL). Accurate IL prediction is crucial for optimizing ultrasound delivery. Traditional grid-based simulation methods for IL prediction are computationally expensive and highly sensitive to parameter variations. We hypothesize that skull structural features inherently correlate with IL and can be effectively captured through deep learning. To investigate this, we conducted transmission experiments on 20 human skull specimens to measure IL at different frequencies and used the results as ground truth to train a modified dual-path Inception-based neural network (mDPI-Net) for IL prediction. Comparison study show that mDPI-Net outperforms other advanced deep architecture and finite difference method (FDM) based simulations, achieving a lower Mean Absolute Error (2.467 dB vs. 3.296 dB) with significantly higher computation efficiency (15 min/sample vs. 0.5 s/sample). The proposed approach demonstrates that, under a well-fixed experimental setup, the skull could inherently encode structural information relevant to IL. As a data-driven method, deep learning has the potential to predict transcranial ultrasound propagation patterns.
